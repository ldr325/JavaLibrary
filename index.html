        <h2> Let me tell you about meat </h2>

        <p class = "threeCol rellax">
          Meat is great. Well it can be great, if you cook it right and if you
          source it right. Meat is not just a food group it's an artfrom. As consumers
          we must be able to ethically source our meat and make sure that there
          will be enough for others. Meat should be sourced with the animal in mind,
          taking great care for it and treating it with respect. That being said
          you must also respect those who are vegan.

          I am going to show my three favorite meats throughout this website. They are
          in no particular order: beef, chicken, goat. You probably expected pork to be
          on that list but im not a big fan of pork unless it is bacon or pulled pork or
          in al pastor tacos. I can never seem to digest pork chops or any other
          grilled pork. Oh Well
        </p>

        <p class = "threeCol rellax">
          I like beef it's not a complicated meat. It can be brought to different flavor
          levels and its easy to cook. It's quite versatile as well and the cow has many
          different cuts. I especially like steak and grilled portions of steak. Not a big
          fan of ground beef but it's not terrible either. Beef stew is also great and you
          can't not mention filet mignon when talking about beef. In short 8/10
        </p>

        <h2> Let's Talk about Chicken </h2>

        <p class = "threeCol" data-aos = "fade-down-left">
          Chicken is also a really versatile meat. It doesnt take a genius to cook it or prepare it.
          Just be careful to not overcook it or undercook it. Chicken is easy to manipluate, you see
          it at almost every fast food joint: chicken sandwiches, chicken tenders, chicken nuggets, wings.
          It's everywhere and goes great with sauces my personal favorite is the polynesian sauce or sweet
          and sour. Chicken even has it's own fast food chain with Chik-fil-a, however they aren't the best
          when it comes to social issues. Overall id give chicken a 9/10
        </p>

        <h2> Let's Talk about Goats </h2>

        <p class = "threeCol">
          The only reason i really put goat here is because of the one dish my family
          makes: barbacoa. It's a really good dish which involves goat being steam
          cooked in an underground oven. It's unique to mexico and the other latin
          american countries. It's origin is said to be from the carribbean and diverged
          from there. This is also where the word barbecue comes from. There are other
          dishes that can be made from goat but not a lot of people in the US eat them,
          nor do i beleive people in the US would be willing to introduce goat as a form
          of meat. Overall 8/10
        </p>
